# Iceium ⛸️❄️
### _National University of Singapore - IS3106 Independent Software Development Project (Orbital) 2020_

Iceium is an ice skating products e-commerce platform. We are targeting the sports retail business domain, specifically the ice skating industry. Since the ice skating scene is rather non-existent in Singapore, there are hardly any physical shops retailing ice skating products and accessories. Iceium is here to help fill in the gap by providing locals with a venue to purchase ice skating products and obtain services related to ice skates customization.

The application consists of 2 front-ends using both server-side (JSF) and client-side (Angular) processing, along with a common backend built with Java EE using EJB, JPA and MySQL.

This application was written for NUS IS3106 Independent Software Development Project (Orbital) 2020.
